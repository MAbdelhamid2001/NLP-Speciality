- I have implemented all possible Text Extraction Techniques
  - Starting with Default `One-Hot-Encoding` and its improvement to Bag of Words `Bow` to represent the occurance or words then using Method Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency AKA `TF-IDF` 
  - Then Implementing Word2vec technique for word vector representation
    - including  Continuous bag of words `CBOW` and `Skip-Gram`
      to get more robust embeddings 
  - Then going into `Glove` and `Fasttext` methods 
  - And the Final one is `Transformers`  to fully understand the context 
- And each one of these methods overcome the drawbacks of its predecessor
